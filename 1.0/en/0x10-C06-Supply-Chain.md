# C6 Supply Chain Security for Models, Frameworks & Data

## Control Objective

AI supply-chain attacks exploit third-party models, frameworks, or datasets to embed backdoors, bias, or exploitable code. These controls ensure traceability, vetting, and monitoring of AI-specific supply chain artifacts throughout the model lifecycle. This chapter focuses on supply chain risks unique to AI: model artifact integrity, backdoor detection in pretrained weights, dataset poisoning, AI-specific bills of materials, and model-publisher trust.

## C6.1 Model Artifact Integrity & Source Trust

Authenticate third-party model origins and check for hidden behavior before fine-tuning or deployment. Download AI artifacts only from approved sources.

| # | Description | Level |
| :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| **6.1.1** | **Verify that** every third-party model artifact can be attested or integrity-verified. | 2 |
| **6.1.2** | **Verify that** models are scanned for malicious code before import. | 1 |
| **6.1.3** | **Verify that** high-risk models remain quarantined until human review and sign-off. | 2 |
| **6.1.4** | **Verify that** third-party or open-source models pass a behavioral acceptance test suite before being imported or promoted to any non-development environment. | 2 |
| **6.1.5** | **Verify that** model weights, datasets, and fine-tuning adapters are downloaded only from approved sources. | 1 |
| **6.1.6** | **Verify that** transfer-learning fine-tuned models are tested against adversarial inputs before deployment. | 3 |

## C6.2 Dataset Risk Assessment

Evaluate external datasets for poisoning and legal compliance, and monitor them throughout their lifecycle.

| # | Description | Level |
| :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| **6.2.1** | **Verify that** disallowed content is detected and removed by automated scrubbing before training. | 1 |
| **6.2.2** | **Verify that** external datasets undergo poisoning risk assessment. | 2 |
| **6.2.3** | **Verify that** periodic monitoring detects drift or corruption in hosted datasets. | 2 |

## C6.3 AI BOM & Supply Chain Monitoring

Generate and sign detailed AI-specific bills of materials and ensure readiness to respond to supply chain compromise events.

| # | Description | Level |
| :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| **6.3.1** | **Verify that** every model artifact publishes a version-controlled, machine-readable AI BOM listing datasets, weights, licenses, and data-origin statements. | 1 |
| **6.3.2** | **Verify that** AI BOMs are cryptographically signed before deployment. | 2 |
| **6.3.3** | **Verify that** AI BOM completeness checks fail the build if any component metadata is missing. | 2 |
| **6.3.4** | **Verify that** incident response playbooks include procedures specific to compromised AI artifacts, such as rollback of poisoned models and revocation of model signatures. | 2 |
